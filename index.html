    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
    <p>"HyperText" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
    <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as head, title, body, etc.</p>
    <p>Tags in HTML are case insensitive. That is, they can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. Example; title tag can be written as Title,TITLE or in any other way.</p>

    <header>Content Sectioning Elements</header>
    <p>Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.</p>
    <p>Examples of common content sectioning elements include:
      <ul>
        <li><code>header</code>- Typically at the top of the page</li>
        <li><code>h1-h6</code>- Titles (important for SEO)</li>
        <li><code>footer</code>- Typically at the very bottom of a webpage</li>
        <li><code>main</code>- The main content of the page</li>
        <li><code>nav</code>- A.k.a Navigation</li>
        <li><code>section</code>- Used to divide content</li>
      </ul>

    <header>HTML Attributes</header>
    <p>Elements in HTML have attributes; these are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want.</p>

    <header>Supported Media Formats</header>
    <p>The audio and video elements provide support for playing audio and video without plug-ins. The format of a media file consists of a container holding one or more streams of data, encoded using a compression format called a codec. A container is identifiable by its file extension. The streams within a container are of multiple types that can include video, audio, data, or captions. A single container (i.e. media file) can hold multiple streams of the same type. Within the audio and video streams are  the codecs. A codec, short for "coder-decoder", is an algorithm for compressing data within a file. Each container type has only specific codecs that it supports.</p>
    <p>It's important to understand why different media formats are needed for the web. For various reasons mostly outside the scope of this article, different browsers support different media formats. Also, the area of media formats on the Web has greatly suffered from patent law in many countries including the USA and EU countries. (The notes on patents in this article are provided as-is and without any warranty.) This article discusses the formats most relevant to the web, including support in browsers on both mobile and desktop.</p>

    <header>Types Of Content</header>
    <p>Every HTML element is a member of one or more content categories â€” these categories group elements that share common characteristics. This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules, especially when you come upon their intricate details. It's also possible for elements to not be a member of any of these categories.</p>
